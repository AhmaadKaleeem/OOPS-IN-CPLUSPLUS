# In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. 
# Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

# Taking Input From User 
textinput = input("Plese Enter The Text In UpperCase : ")

# using built-in str function to lowercase output
textinput = textinput.lower()

# PRINTING OUTPUT
print (textinput)
